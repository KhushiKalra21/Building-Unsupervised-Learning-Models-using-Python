Building Unsupervised Learning Models using Python: Clustering {Hierarchical | K-Means}

### Project Overview
This project explores unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset related to imports and exports. The goal was to build clustering models (Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means) and classification models (Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression) to understand data patterns and predict product categories.

What Has Been Done:

1. Data Preprocessing:

  Handled missing data using techniques like mean imputation.
  Categorical variables were encoded using ordinal encoding.
  Variables with excessive missing data or constants were removed to improve model performance.

2. Unsupervised Learning:

  Implemented Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Clustering to group data into meaningful 
  clusters based on similarities.

3. Supervised Learning:

  Built classification models using Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression to 
  predict the 'Category' variable.
  Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were evaluated, with 
  models achieving 100% accuracy.

4. Model Evaluation:

  Performance was evaluated based on key metrics, with recommendations for cross-validation and 
  hyperparameter tuning to address overfitting concerns.

  
How It Is Useful:

Business Insights: 
The clustering models help in identifying natural groupings in the data, providing insights into product categorization and potential market segmentation.

Predictive Analysis: 
The classification models allow for accurate predictions of product categories, which can be valuable for decision-making in inventory management, sales forecasting, and market analysis.

Data-Driven Decisions: 
The comprehensive analysis of the dataset offers a foundation for better understanding of imports and exports, enabling more efficient resource allocation and strategy development.

This project combines fundamental machine learning techniques with practical applications in business analytics, providing both insights and actionable predictions for industry use cases.
